We found each other randomly staying in Kingston at the same time and were talking about the possibility to shoot a subject.  So we developed what I call a one-night-stand project, meaning that we spent from midnight to 5am, shooting in Tivoli Gardens at Passa Passa, one of the most legendary and legitimate street parties in Jamaica, and we called that project “Small Kings.” So before arriving to “I & I,” we did other projects and were able to explore many layers of Jamaican culture. Our curiosity about the culture really drove us to discover deeper aspects of the island.  I have friends born and raised in Jamaica that told me, ‘You guys saw stuff that I’ve never seen before.’  And so I developed an attachment to Jamaica, with Anicée’s insight as well.  It’s the country I’ve visited the most, if you don’t count Italy.

Anicée perceived, before others I think, this new wave of young spiritual reggae artists.  People from the dancehall scene were stepping into a more thoughtful and spiritual way to convey their message, which is reggae, as we know it from Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and that era.  What I do before I shoot, as an exercise, is to think about the subject I’m going to shoot – reggae has been massively documented – so I steer clear of stereotypes.   So before, during, and after the shooting and the preparation of the book, somehow I knew what I wanted to include and not include – always trying to avoid elements that would make this book expected.

Not to compare it to the big artists, but it’s similar to a painting by Lucio Fontana. With a photo, you think about something and you shoot in a fraction of a second.

Captureland was shot in the very welcoming and historic community or Port Royal, Kingston - Jamaica.   \n\nCapture Land was made as part of The Power of Words series. In partnership with the Tribeca Film Institute and the Nelson Mandela Foundation, this initiative inspires filmmakers to explore the written legacy of influential figures as a source of story and using film as a tool of education. In its inaugural year, the series will look at the teachings and writings of Nelson Mandela as inspiration for story.","thumbnail_url_with_play_button":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src=https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/499005831_295x166.jpg&src=http://f.vimeocdn.com/p/images/crawler_play.png","upload_date":"2014-11-27 01:09:03","video_id":112987664,"uri":"/videos/112987664","embed_url":"https://vimeo.com/112987664","type":"video","version":"1.0","title":"CAPTURELAND","author_name":"nabil elderkin","author_url":"https://vimeo.com/nabilelderkin","provider_name":"Vimeo","provider_url":"https://vimeo.com/","cache_age":null,"thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/499005831_295x166.jpg","thumbnail_width":295,"thumbnail_height":166,"html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/112987664\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"CAPTURELAND\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>"}},{"image":{"id":"V7QGtSoAALIKvY1D","url":"https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/index-la%2Fc61eef96-3c45-4b97-8d4b-aa36d4687f47_542247540_1280x720.jpg","name":"542247540_1280x720.jpg","kind":"image","date":"08/16/16 23:37","size":"213667","width":"1280","height":"720","wioUrl":"wio://medias/V7QGtSoAALIKvY1D"},"video":{"is_plus":"0","width":480,"height":270,"duration":183,"description":"Director: NABIL\nDP: Elodie Tathane\nEditor: Hugo Lemant\nProduction co: Phantasm\nFX: Gloria VFX\nColor grading: Mathieu Caplanne\nPP ()\\: Nightshift \nLine Producer: Mélodie Buchris\nSteadicam: Rémi Quilichini\nSet Decorator: Arnaud Roth","thumbnail_url_with_play_button":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src=https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/542247540_295x166.jpg&src=http://f.vimeocdn.com/p/images/crawler_play.png","upload_date":"2015-10-22 07:30:58","video_id":143246060,"uri":"/videos/143246060","embed_url":"https://vimeo.com/143246060","type":"video","version":"1.0","title":"TRAVI$ SCOTT x  KANYE WEST  x Piss on your Grave","author_name":"nabil elderkin","author_url":"https://vimeo.com/nabilelderkin","provider_name":"Vimeo","provider_url":"https://vimeo.com/","cache_age":null,"thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/542247540_295x166.jpg","thumbnail_width":295,"thumbnail_height":166,"html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/143246060\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"TRAVI$ SCOTT x  KANYE WEST  x Piss on your Grave\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>"}}]}

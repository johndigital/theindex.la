What used to be a pre Incan fishing town has become a privileged beach resort after the Spanish colony. With an observational lens, En Ancon explores the space of memory to uncover the filmmaker's childhood where she spent her summers.With distance in time and space, and with the desire to observe and re-examine a place from the past, comes a different gaze and an evolution of thought and awareness. \n\nThe separation provides more opportunity of seeing things as they are. With space and time comes clarity. The filmmaker is familiar to this place, but has now grown from being born into this mentality and this system. Through the nostalgic eyes of adulthood En Ancon sheds a light to expose the existing barriers of class segregation that pertain in Peru. It also investigates the process of realizing the system we are in, in order to break off from it, and the process of change as a path to liberation. \n\n“The square-format full-body candid portraits depict individuals or groups of people paused on the boardwalk in the coastal Ancón district with the horizon line falling just below the center of the image. Franco explains that there are rigid boundary lines (visible and invisible) along the beach busy at work highlighting public versus private (space) and white versus indigenous. (...)\nFranco complicates the relationship of these spaces by first acknowledging their existence and then editing together her observational footage documenting the stark inequalities in the use of space along the shore.” — From Notions of Line(s), by Molly Sullivan","thumbnail_url_with_play_button":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src=https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/524173903_640.jpg&src=http://f.vimeocdn.com/p/images/crawler_play.png","upload_date":"2012-05-24 04:16:17","video_id":42754129,"uri":"/videos/42754129","embed_url":"https://vimeo.com/42754129","type":"video","version":"1.0","title":"En Ancón ( In Ancon)","author_name":"Andrea Franco Batievsky","author_url":"https://vimeo.com/andreafranco","provider_name":"Vimeo","provider_url":"https://vimeo.com/","cache_age":null,"thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/524173903_640.jpg","thumbnail_width":640,"thumbnail_height":360,"html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/42754129\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"En Anc&oacute;n ( In Ancon)\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>"}},{"video":{"is_plus":"0","width":640,"height":360,"duration":41,"description":"Sinopsis\nA través de conversaciones con su abuela, su madre y sus empleados domésticos, la cineasta\nexplora la vida y el trabajo de su abuelo Bernardo Batievsky, quien fue un progresivo cineasta\nperuano desde los años setenta.

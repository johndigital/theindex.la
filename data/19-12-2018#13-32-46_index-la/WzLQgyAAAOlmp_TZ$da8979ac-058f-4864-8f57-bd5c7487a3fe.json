Through liquid time, we will follow a rabbit past different homes, different lives until we find our own. The Airbnb traveling experience is very unique and very personal. We look for a place that, for that short period of time, will become our home. Signs of people that have been here are embedded all around us and as we pass through them, we leave our own. When we started concepting ideas for the project we felt a strong desire, almost a need to show this flowing cycle. We move past apartments where we see lives, apartments where time passes just a little too quickly, apartments where we want to stay a little longer. As we watch the warm morning in Barcelona become a cool night in New Zealand a particular feeling evokes inside us; a feeling of a dream.\n\nBRAND\nAirbnb\n\nCONCEPT DEVELOPMENT\nBipolar Studio\n\nDIRECTION, PRODUCTION, CGI\nBipolar Studio","thumbnail_url_with_play_button":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src0=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F689077554_640.jpg&src1=http%3A%2F%2Ff.vimeocdn.com%2Fp%2Fimages%2Fcrawler_play.png","upload_date":"2018-03-16 00:54:08","video_id":260363437,"uri":"/videos/260363437","embed_url":"https://vimeo.com/260363437","type":"video","version":"1.0","title":"Airbnb | Follow The Rabbit","author_name":"Bipolar Studio","author_url":"https://vimeo.com/bipolarstudio","provider_name":"Vimeo","provider_url":"https://vimeo.com/","cache_age":null,"thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/689077554_640.jpg","thumbnail_width":640,"thumbnail_height":274,"html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/260363437?app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Airbnb | Follow The Rabbit\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>"}},{"image":{"id":"WzLQDCAAAC5up_LA","url":"https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/index-la%2Fb7ff27d7-75ab-4323-bcaf-be2b1c00fe30_bipolar_2.jpg","name":"bipolar_2.jpg","kind":"image","date":"06/26/18 23:44","size":"26298","width":"1400","height":"583","wioUrl":"wio://medias/WzLQDCAAAC5up_LA"},"video":{"is_plus":"0","account_type":"business","width":640,"height":330,"duration":74,"description":"Coming soon in VR!\n\nwww.bipolarstudio.la\n\nCASE STUDY VIDEO: https://vimeo.com/260363413\n\nPilots in two different vehicles converge at high speeds, aligning with each other for a brief encounter.\nWe wanted to create a cinematic with the Porsche 911 Turbo S, that felt more like a short, or a segment from a film rather than a traditional commercial.\n\nIt was important for us to capture the dual nature of the vehicle; the minimal, almost sculptural beauty with the brutal force that propels it into motion.
